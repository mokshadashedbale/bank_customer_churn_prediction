# Bank Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest

This repository contains the implementation of a Random Forest supervised machine learning model for analyzing bank customer churn dataset. The model was developed using Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. By predicting churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features

- Developed and implemented a Random Forest supervised machine learning model.
- Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Utilized sampling techniques to address class imbalance and enhance model performance.
- Achieved significant improvement in model accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and AUROC score through hyperparameter tuning and rigorous evaluation of test data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about bank customers, including demographics, account information, and transaction history. The target variable is whether a customer churned or not.

## Dependencies

- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/mokshadashedbale/bank_customer_prediction.git
2. Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt 
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `bank_customer_churn_modelling.ipynb` to see the implementation and results.
